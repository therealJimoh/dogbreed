# A full stack web app that displays dog breeds and random fun activity - Dogs

This is the starter code for a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) server
using the [Koa web framework](https://koajs.com/). There is a frontend code in [React.Js](https://reactjs.org/) which should be served to the user.

## Getting started

To get this project functionally working locally;

- You will need to install Node.js.

For best results, use [**Node.js >= 16**](https://nodejs.org/).

You can check your current version of Node.js like this:

```sh
$ node --version
v16.13.1
```
- Download or clone the repo into your directory

- Use this command on your cmd or terminal
```sh
git clone https://github.com/therealJimoh/dogbreed
```

- Change into the root directory if you are not already there. Use:
```sh
cd dogbreed
```

- Then, inside this project, run

```sh
npm install
```

# To get the backend server running, run this in the project directory

```sh
npm run server
```

If the server starts successfully, you will see

```sh
Server running on http://localhost:3011
```

# To get the Frontend running

 - Navigate to the frontend directory. Use this
```sh
cd frontend
```

Then, inside it, run

```sh
npm install
```

- To start the frontend application, change to the root directory of the project and run

```sh
npm start
```

If it starts successfully, you will see

```sh
You can now view in the browser at Local:  http://localhost:3011
```
